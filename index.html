              <li>Diving into a good show, documentary, or podcast and (sometimes) going on a binge-watch session when it's really captivating.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
          <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">I love learning things; I just learned that someone who loves to learn things is known as a philomath.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">I am passionate about cultural anthropology, which was my minor in undergrad, and being exposed to new cultures as it helps me grow as a person.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">I collect vinyl records -- some old classics I grew up with like Queen and the Ramones, and newer releases from my favorite artists, such as Taylor Swift, Bring Me The Horizon, and My Chemical Romance, for example. I just think there is something special in the experience of listening to music in vinyl form.</li>
